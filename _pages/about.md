<strong>Basics </strong>
Hello! I'm Jovina. Indonesian living in Singapore. I'm a design student initially majoring in Graphic Communications, but after a chance encounter with UI/UX Design, I was hooked. 

Update 10/05/23: Have decided to postpone further education and currently taking a gap year! 

<strong>Design philosophy</strong>
In order to design, I find it crucial to nourish myself with a myriad of interests - feed myself creatively. I'm always learning (recently about Ruby and developing this site!), designing or inching through my [[bookshelf]] of science fiction and Haruki Murakami. 

<strong>Site notes </strong>
My toolkit as of now consists of Obsidian, Github and Jekyll. This is pretty challenging for me considering I'm not from a technical background, but I'm having fun nerding out 🤓. I built this digital garden through an open-source and free template [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).
