<strong>Basics </strong>
Hello! I'm Jovina. Indonesian living in Singapore. I'm a design student initially majoring in Graphic Communications, but after a chance encounter with UI/UX Design, I was hooked. 

<strong>Design philosophy</strong>
In order to design, I find it crucial to nourish myself with a myriad of interests - feed myself creatively, persay. I am always educating myself (recently on Ruby and developing this site!), creating fictional worlds through graphic design or inching through my [[bookshelf]] of science fiction and Haruki Murakami. Read more on my philosophy on design here: [[research|How research builds the designer]]

<strong> Fun facts </strong>
-    My very first design software was Superimpose on my mom's iPhone 4. 
-    People back home call me Jonbon (Because Jon Bon Jovi(na), get it?). My dad loves Bon Jovi, and my family owns a homey cafe called Jonbon's coffee and eatery. Shameless plug but feel free to drop by if you're in the North Jakarta area and looking to chill.
-    Other than a full-time student, I am also a full-time freelancer. I'm always open to help people, communities, companies with my craft - be it in the field of graphic or UX design.
-    I love storytelling. Words to me are as important a tool for design as Figma. I write about all sort of things from design, book reviews, to why I hate [[birthdays]].
