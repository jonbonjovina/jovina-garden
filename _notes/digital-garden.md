title: Digital Garden
---

Last year, I made the decision to start writing consistently and post it publicly. My platform of choice was Medium due to its simple interface and established community. I published one article, generating 352 appreciations and I thought - Wow, this is it, I'm not gonna give this up like all my other short-lived hobbies. Spoiler alert, I didn't end up doing it consistently enough. I could list out a psychoanalysis of why and make up excuses but it's simple really - perfection became my excuse for procrastination. It wasn't sustainable to spend weeks writing 1 article and end up never publishing it for fear of faults. I never hit the publish button again. 

I thought long and hard about what I could do to ameliorate this. For one, I love writing and I was already doing it - for myself. Two, writing helps me learn and grasp concepts, remember my learnings, reflect on experiences and be a better human being overall. That's when I stumbled on the Digital Garden through Are.na, which is another gem on its own. 

## So what is a digital garden anyway? 

Anne-Laure Le Cunff, CEO of Nesslabs (an awesome newsletter I reccommend!) defined it as

>A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.

Metaphors for the mind being a garden is not original to this newly-found concept, born post-interweb conception. In fact, Bruce Lee said it first 

>The mind is a fertile garden - it will grow anything you wish to plant, beautiful flowers or weeds

Though it borrows from concepts of mindfulness, the same goes. Our mind is a garden, our curiosity is the seed which we plant, hoping one day they turn out to strong trees of knowledge. Borrowing concepts from gardening has made this very fun for me, a houseplant and metaphor enthusiast. So TLDR: 

- A **seed** is a note on a topic I am curious about. 
- A **tree** is curiosity that has blossomed into knowledge. 
- **Fruits** are new thoughts and ideas
- This **ecosystem** is inextricably linked to each other. 
- Tending and pruning will be done everyday, without hurry
- A garden is always a work in progress, just as we are always working on ourselves

All in all, the goal for this digital garden is so that I tend to my curiosity in a way that is sustainable. In an incremental manner instead of a one-off essay writing project. The best part about this undeniably is that I never have to hit the publish button ever again. 

Arguably, I still do have to hit "git commit" and "git push" and the set up for the workflow was extremely challenging for me, a non-techie. Which brings me to my 2nd point 

## How I build one, and if it's worth it or not

There were some considerations on which platform to use. Finally, I settled on a toolkit consisting of Obsidian, Jekyll, Netlify and Github. It seems like a lot, but bear with me because an absolute newbie actually managed. 

- Obsidian for taking notes 
- Github for the repository 
- Netlify for speedy hosting 
- Ruby and Jekyll for the build itself, using a template
- VSCode for mild code editting 

The topic of [meta procrastination](https://betterhumans.pub/are-you-guilty-of-meta-procrastination-982e3648eb7e) (there may be a better buzzword for it but I don't know) whereby you procrastinate through doing activities that prepare you for productivity is one I've definitely been guilty of. Such as binge watching other people's notion tours. I'm debating whether this now is a byproduct of it, but I digress.

Building a digital garden is worth it because for the first time, I'm coming into it with the notion that I can be patient with it and tend to it sustainably.
