I'd interpret it as 'keeping as many options as possible, just in case one fails'. 

### How do we combat this fallacy?
- Knowing that we don't know what we don't know. We cannot guess what will work and won't work in this vastly changing landscape. With the AI revolution, lots of people will be out of jobs, even if they are prestigious degree holders with tons of experiences. Staying humble and keeping on learning and adapting. 
- Thoughtful trial and error. Tinkering and experimenting with our skills and challenging our beliefs, skills and limits. As Anne-Laure puts it *"Tinkering and experimenting is a more efficient investment of your time than following a set path of learning which assumes an intrinsic value in specific skills and ignores the non-linear way life works."*
