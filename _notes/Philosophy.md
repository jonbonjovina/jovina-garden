**every birth comes with it the possibility of a changed world**
human lives are cyclical, beginning with birth, ending in death, as is everything in nature. However, what truly differentiates us from animals and trees is free will, deeds, words. Unlike plants and animals, we are born not to die but to begin. With that, love reveals the glory of a person, who that person is. For this fact alone humans are unique, not just animals with tastes and preferences. In order to revel in the glory, we first must begin. 

## Emmanuel kant 
**human reason acknowledges limitation yet still enquires** 
because of how limited we are, we have no way of proving whether the meta exists or not, but it is inherently what it means to be human - to enquire. What strips us away of this human quality is blindly accepting dogma. This is relevant because his central philosophy stated that freedom is the central of what it means to be human - that we are free to govern our own lives and that we have reasoning ability allows us to create whatever need be in order to create a meaningful existence for ourselves.
