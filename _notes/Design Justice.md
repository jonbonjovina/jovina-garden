[Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ad431dac-da69-4a11-9fec-10b174855393) by Sasha Constanza-Chock 

Read this book last year during my internship. 

Some loose notes:

1.  _Startup culture is harmful_
    - As hackathons continue to boom, people linger around the thought that digital solutions can pretty much solve any and everything.
    - Most of these designers are educated cis white men
    - What matters inherently is not tool adoption but people's lived experiences need to be taken into account. Quick fixes will never sub for capacity building
    - Why waste so much resources and thought on technology without ever thinking of the people you are designing it for? Building a new table instead of coming to the table.
    

2. _The universalist approach is the worst approach_
    -  The erasure of communities and humans into the "user". Even in the book refered to as the bible of UX, there is really little to no reference of how to design with inclusion in mind.
    - Again, we come back to how the default is educated cis white men. Hand soapÂ dispensers won't detect dark skintones, and facial recognition can't detect epicanthic folds
