*On the conflagation of my design philosophy. On the difference of designing as a student and designing in the real world. 

Much debate has gone around what it means to design, largely in service to the timeless question of whether it's an art or science. In my humble opinion, more time should be spent thinking about what design as a discipline brings to the table rather than the similarities it posesses with other disciplines. My favorite definition of design by far was coined by Ezio Manzini in his book, Design When everybody designs. In an ever-changing world with ever-changing problems, design exists as an evolving service backed with a profound knowledge. Since this realization, little has been able to match the satisfaction I get through accruing knowledge by which I may design thoughtful solutions. 

In order to do that, I had to stop and think about my role and impact as a designer, what kind of beliefs and biases that I was subscribing to, and the potential of undermining or supporting certain systems or parties with the work that I put out. Stumbling upon Kentaro Toyama's talk on youtube titled [ "What if Good Design isn't enough?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QagUGLN4rsM)triggered the first spark in the conflagation of my design philosophy. 

## The first spark: Is good design enough?

His thesis centers around the law of amplification, essentially - technology amplifies human behaviour and has no power to solve societal issues by itself. What does it mean when human intent is amplified? For example: good human intent. I am able to thrust this far because of the technologies I have used as a stepping stone. *Hardware: my crusty 2017 i5 macbook, despite how scary the sound the fan makes when I'm opening up Cinema4D. Software: I owe so much of my knowledge to twitter and netflix and pirate websites back in the day (RIP Zlibary).* Yet, these technologies are only beneficial to me because of 1. my own intent and 2. my situational context. Because the value of education has been instilled in me by my parents since birth, because I'm literate, because I have access to the internet and electricity, because I acknowledge fully my privilege whilst saying this. **Technology, even the flashiest and the most robust, does absolutely nothing for people who don't have the privilege access to it or don't care for it.** The best user interface designed in the world is redundant in the hands of illiterate people. Good design wasn't enough.

An example of this is Bill Gates' smart toilet project. A million dollar research project spanning several years to turn human feces into ashes. Amazing potential to solve the problem of sanitation in drought-stricken countries where clean water can be sparce. But till now, 12 years has passed, it's still a prototype and the communities it was designed for has not benefitted from it yet. Could the funding have been more effective if allocated towards more conventional solutions like building better sewage infrastructure instead? Possibly.

Techbro culture might argue otherwise. The boom in hackathons has got people thinking that an app can solve every issue there is. (Source: [[Design Justice]]) These issues were, to put in perspective, limited to the worldviews of the builders themselves, who more often than not were educated people living in Sillicon Valley in positions of privilege. Their problems were overrepresented, dareisay trivial even. Their solutions were quick-fixes, focused on tool adoption rather than capacity building. "Hey download this app and it'll fix your life" their marketing team says. 

No hate to techbros. I think having this type of anti-techbro thinking hindrances people from making courageous technological innovation to solve critical issues. But unlike the tools which amplifies it, the way the world works is agnostic towards human intent, no? The clock is ticking on some of these issues, the most obvious one being climate change. Who actually has a say in what gets build and what doesn't? Centralized big tech companies. It's scary to think the amount of power that an individual or a single corporation can hold in the power fulcrum. 

Kentaro Toyama's book Geek Heresy helped me to realize - I'd love to live in a world where more solutions tip the scale. The kind of solutions that offer to come to the table foremost before building a new table. The kind of solutions rooted in listening to the hum of the streets around you and having honest conversations with people. Even better if I can be a designer contributing to that kind of solution. From birth, I'd already been a dreamer, an altruist at heart, and with this in mind I no longer house regrets for choosing this field and going to design school.

Design school gave me the liberty and autonomy to create whatever projects I wanted, talk about and solve whatever issue I'm passionate about. Last year, I designed a decentralized speculative browser because it was horrendous to me how big tech companies were censoring videos of human rights abuse. I was neck deep in my conviction for this vision. When I won a design competition advocating against violence for Migrant Domestic Workers, I nearly cried during the interview when asked why I decided to join. I don't know what it's like to have an abusive employer and a physically demanding job, but because many of these MDWs were Indonesian immigrants as I was, I felt their woes so deeply. Trying to find solace in Singapore is hard for anyone. 

Designing for impact fullfilled me. But this is also the point where the rose-tinted glasses that had gotten me this far started to shatter. 

## The forest fire: Is design even enough? Will anything ever be?

It's deliriously exciting to be surrounded by design and innovation all the time. So much so that when it came to the real world and what kind of problems out there where up for adoption to solve, it hurt. Noone around me was actually working on issues like clean energy, systemic racism, socioeconomic mobility (LOL). Corporate singapore has a whopping **1,580** companies in the fintech industry. My design philosophy rooted in "the heart of design is an opportunity to problem solve" seemed like a fraudulent elegy now.

Is this what they call an impostor syndrome? Why did it seem like my arm and leg had already been cut off before I'd even entered the industry with what I have to offer yet? As a kid, we were taught to dream big. As a student, we were taught to write personal statements on how we want to change the world. They don't tell you that those opportunities are scarce and they don't get handed to you even if your educational institution is renowned or you come from privilege. Luck is a factor. Tenacity is crucial. You gotta have the tenacity to bleed through the shards of your own rose-tinted glasses before you can even begin to see clearly. In a spontaneous moment of clarity, I grew the courage to take matters into my own hands and crushed my rose-tinted glasses myself. 

Only then did I see what I thought was my carefully cultivated garden had been overgrown foliage all along. And a wildfire, a cleansing ritual, had already begun. 

There's a saying that goes purpose is when a problem meets your capacity and capability. To me, maturing is realizing that a problem needs to be looked at from all the angles to be determined if it's worth solving or not. There's a myriad of other factors that come into play with building out a solution, such as timing, consequence, world landscape, monetization and business outcomes, legal and technological constraints. It's the kind of high-level thinking that school and formal education doesn't teach, but playing with the opportunities that life offers does. We have to be humble and receptive and tune ourselves to listen. 

In Michelle Obama's book 'Becoming', she mentions one of the reason she fell in love with Barrack Obama is because his conviction goes more than "getting out of a stuck place, but getting the place unstuck in the first place". Inspiring. But maturity is also acknowledging that in order to complete the latter we need to not be stuck in the first place. To help people you need to help yourself first. 

And to help yourself you gotta acknowledge your helplessness first. In the phases of design thinking, the empathy stage is the most crucial. Facilitating good user interviews requires dismantling any preconceived assumptions beforehand. Yesterday, I attended a userflow mapping session for an Esports SaaS and was asked by the UX lead if I played any games. I answered farmville like an absolute savage. If you ask me what the hell I'm doing there, I literally have no clue. It's a good thing, I think, to be clueless and let life in without expectations. It gives you the freedom to be more open towards learning new things and rewiring your thinking, like malleable wet clay in the right ways. I wouldn't have struggled so badly with impostor syndrome had I acknowledged the harsh truths that clung so fervently to my dreams earlier. But alas, regretting does nothing. 

## The new soil: If it doesn't serve you, kill it with fire

Speaking of letting life in and trying new things, lately I've been obsessed with nature documentaries on Netflix. I finished the whole "Our Planet" series in 2 days. Did you know that wildfires are actually beneficial to ecological balance? Dead organic matter born from these wildfires in turn increase soil fertility, cultivating more life. Several plants actually require fire to move along their life cycles. For example, seeds from many pine tree species are enclosed in pine cones that are covered in pitch, which must be melted by fire for the seeds to be released. It's amazing how nature works in cyclical ways. Death precedes life precedes death. 

You and I are seeds burried in the ground, waiting for a worthy fire to inspire our conflagation. To prepare myself to come into this next phase of life, I took everything I know, wrote it in a piece of paper, and watched it burn into flames. I said good riddance to naivety, embracing the newly spacious landscape in my mind, watching as dust and debris flew around me in the air. The ground has to stir with death for the air to buzz with sweet potential.
