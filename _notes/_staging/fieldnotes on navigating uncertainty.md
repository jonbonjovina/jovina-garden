At 10 years old, my baby niece 'A' is no longer a baby. She's unexpectedly muscular, curious, and incredibly smart, taking two CCAs -  Gymnastics alongside Science and Environmental Club. She talks to and operates Google Home like it's not at all some futuristic technology, comes home late from school because she's out catching ladybugs, and recently, she's been copying me. In true *Jovina* fashion, she wears - around her neck - a pair of headphones. Not beat-up sonys like mine, her headphones are wired, green, macaron-shaped with a dinosaur-pattern, and when she wears them, the butt/jack hangs loosely, reaching her stomach. The thing is, 'A' doesn't have a phone yet, but she carries them around all-day. Why? it has no functionality other than style, right? So is it to feel cool and edgy? to be like Aunty? 

Here's the thing that most adults don't get about children - they're infinitely hopeful. In other words, agnostic towards the realm of rationalization and likely-to-happen scenarios. She carries headphones around not to fit in or to stand out, but in the off chance that she gets to plug it in a random headphone jack and listen to music. This exact scenario happened on the 4 hour bus we rode from Malaysia to Singapore. ***"Oh neat! I found a place to plug in my headphones so I can listen to music"***. I can vouch for the beam she had on her face when she plugged it in the bus dashboard's jack and it worked. 

I'm thinking of this observation from 30,000 feet up in the air, as I leave Singapore and go back to the place I call home. I'm trying to reflect on the Me I was from December of last year, gripping her headphones tightly in her fist - as firm as her mental resolution. *I never want to feel this way again, I'll turn my life around this year, God help me.* I don't think I've ever felt that much conviction coursing through my veins, as I draft out goals and 10 year plans to build out my life. Back then, I was holding on, quite desperately, to the belief that there's a headphone jack out there with my name on it. A headphone jack that's gonna solve all my problems. I can't help but laugh to myself, realizing so much has changed but also nothing has. *We free up so much of our lifeforce when we make room for improvisations in the script of our lives.* 

There's a visceral problem with how we see "plans" and "pivots" in our lives. We think they're at odds with each other. These pivots could be a myriad of things - but my favorite of them, chance. What's funny is, for anxious people like me, we tend to just...don't buy chance. For ourselves and other people. We think everyone arrives at where they are right now because they make calculated decisions and minimize on risks taken to get there. **We discount on the probability of chances and take safe routes, convincing ourselves the price we paid to get to the default plan is too expensive for us to pivot.** 

With the looming question of "Should I work or should I further study?" over my life, I find myself constantly thinking of the timeless debate of whether a university education dictates success or not. When I came across this graph for the very first time, I had to really stop and think to myself for a good 10 minutes. Let it sink in and ask yourself too - what kind of belief systems are you subscribing to?

Humans are wired to seek knowledge and personal fullfillment. The hard-turn in the 1970s was just the idea of what it looked like. From the desired outcome of a college education being a life of enlightenment, it became economic prosperity. Universities focused on not delivering good contributing members of society, but attractive job candidates. Consequently, this common idea of education and career became the default path. And in this day and age, it's a crazy expensive default path. A price paid too expensive to even think of pivoting. A risk too big to take.

## F*** the jack, follow the music 
It's not all so bleak though. Here's what I've come to realize 6 months from that season of questions - that it's not a headphone jack that I'm desperately looking for. Pivot. Zoom out. It's something much, much bigger than that. I know now. Much like my niece, I'm looking for new music to permeate my soul. The wonderful thing is, in actuality, I think it finds me more than I find it. In discreet bus dashboards, in tuning in to the hum of the streets around me, dancing wildly in empty sidewalks, and mostly, I find my favorite kind of music in raw and honest conversations with other people. More music and synergy happens at 8am in a crowded hawker centre at Bishan Interchange than it does at your mall-brand electronic store trying to sell you speakers. 

And when you follow where the music leads you, you're unconstrained by any default path, you don't care if people watching find it stupid, you're not even limited by your liminal motoric dancing skills. A tiny headphone jack out there with your name out there *may* exist, and it *may* absolve you of all your problems. The second you plug it in, everything in your life could just makes sense. Ask yourself this - what does it look like? Economic prosperity and a good career, as the default path says? Or is it belonging, a pair of arms to call home? Freedom, perhaps for some. This is a question I should hope to spend the rest of my life looking for. What it looks like, how to get there, and even whether it exists or not is beyond any of us. What's within our control is our worldview. It's up to us to make meaning of the long journey to get there. *And the key to sustaining is simple - we need to fall in love with the question, not our idea of the answer.*  I come back to poetry a lot to seek solace, and since the fall of last year, this quote by Rilke has been my mantra. Please read it, read it outloud, and read it again if everything I've mentioned thus far has been relatable in the least.

 "Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer."   <span style="font-weight: bold">  - Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters To A Young Poet </span>

There are lots of things I want to achieve, many things I want to learn, both technically speaking and philosophically speaking.  A list of adjectives I want to someday describe myself as - **brave, intellectual, compassionate**. When I catch myself agitated, hands-itching to write down roadmaps, eyes wide open at 3am trying to foresee the future, I find that the most effective thing I can do is to stop and slow down. Counter-intuitive, isn't it? As humans, we're obsessed with security to our own detriment, primed to crave utility and stray from risks. I used to be that type of student who wouldn't leave her desk unless she finished the work she promised herself she'd finish. No half-assing anything when so much is at stake as an international student under a tution grant scheme, you know. 

A concept from my favorite anime of all time, Fulmetal Alchemist, is Law of Alchemy or of equal exchange. That to gain something we must give something of equal value. So, to truly go "Screw the path, I'll follow the music", one must sacrifice many mental luxuries. Ego's the first to go. Acknowledging and being okay with being a work in progress. Being okay with taking longer to figure things out. Being okay with knowing absolutely nothing. Being a half-finished thing. And the second part - to embrace it. 

> "For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream." - Vincent Van Gogh

There is so much to discover in uncertainty, or phenomenons that aren't clearly tangible, futures and risks that aren't so visible. Isn't it entrancing to bask in it all? Every concept unknown, every unfathomable utterance, every technology birthed, presents itself as an invitation for me to learn. *My god, there is so much out there to learn.* A new language. T.S. Elliot's body of work. Mushroom cultivation. Headless E-Commerce architecture. Doing the lato-lato thing. 

For now, I'm wet clay in the hands of the universe and my maker. Sometimes, this sort of feels like the easy way out. It looks like resignation. It's the opposite. Trusting in the uncertainty is the hardest playing field I've ever been in my life. To me, it's an act of courage, to toss away the mental models that society has conditioned me to, to be patient with the way the story is being narrated, to give unstructured space for pivots.

Striking the balance is difficult. You can't be too porous and soft or you won't ever take form, whilst you can't be too stubborn or act like a know it all or you won't ever align. Malleability has be to matched with intentionality. Consequently, to balance, I slow down. I put my ear to ground and tune out noise, as I try to listen to what truly matters - my own heart. And so, here is an ode to myself, that though the summer sun may scorch, and rain, while nourishes, can be a rattling thing, I shall not doubt the wisdom in the air and in the soil. That I trust that roots are stubborn when they want to grow. That light can penetrate its talons through soil and sea. That I promise to 'do my thing' with dignity and candor, though I don't have visibility on what it looks like today and tomorrow. That although I'm a half-finished thing now, I'll let the poem in me lead my life to where it has to go find those words. That the powerful play goes on, that I may someday, to contribute a verse. 








how does one think of encounter without thinking of absence? how does one think of meetings without thinking of arriving too early or too late? how does one love without thinking of hurt? how do i know  my love, so devoted and so unfrequented, does not feel like a hunt itself? like a cub it was raised to feed on the visceral impulse of hunger. with clumsy fingers it was modelled after a clumsy parenthood.
 
 
 hi here’s some of my fav things hehe, my fav song in the world is melt with you - modern english, my favorite author murakami, i like  giving people the benefit of the doubt, and i think going to the movies alone isnt weird at all. i dont call my family as often as i should, im always obsessing over something and unapologetically oversharing (as u can see). lately im trying to get to know myself better, and its surprising because the more you try the more you realize u contradict urself. thats fine also. have a good day ahead yeehaw



What I've learned from A is that there are thousands of people out there who will look at you like you're crazy for wearing unplugged macaron-shaped dinosaur headphones, and it's easy to misunderstand, in an adult's POV, that she's 'bearing the burden of carrying it around" or that she's intensely looking for the tiny headphone jack that will make the problems and the situations in her life finally makes sense. 


I love the quote *"Do I contradict myself? then I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes"*

I want to do what I love. I want to solve for distribution. I want to rest. I want to be prolific and create art. I want to work on myself and grow. I want to finally accept myself and my shortcomings. 

Why do I always feel like a dichotomous binary opposition with myself? The question looms over every decision as I find myself torn. 

I think education has taught us that we should be boxed to roles and we can only be one thing. Comfort in maths and science and things that are proven to be true. 

Being a designer has taught me to balance that. Whilst we value aesthetics, we never discount for the user's experience. Whilst we act on insights and data, we don't forget to be compassionate and empathetic. 



I seek solace from words of pioneers from the previous era. To be a pioneer in a certain craft I can imagine it takes a great deal to grapple with uncertainty. The first to do something - How do you fathom doing that in this era where every idea is a remix and every thought unoriginal?

It's only been this year that I'm starting to realize that it'sokay to be both and to live with uncertainty. That what I'm doing now - learning - is not to fit into a profession or role, but I am learning the skillsets I need in order for me to the person I want to be. I'm enabling myself. Not repressing myself. Why does education feel that way? 

Let's redefine everything. Start with a blank page and new map. 

Let's be educated, not schooled. And to educate yourself starts with innate curiosity, and acknowledging not knowing something as a propeller, an exciting invitation to learn. 


Let's both love and live the questions in our heart as we make our way towards the answer. 



I would rather be the cat killed by curiosity than die in the false security of being "smart" with the limited knowledge that I know. 



- If there's one thing i need to carry out into my gap year it is a curiosity and zest for uncertainty, to look aty the questions differently and with gusto. To be entranced in the unexpected rain that life offers. I have an umbrella with me bt am i choosing to open it up and use it? 
- No, I am not living life looking for a headphone jack. I am looking for new music to permeate my ears and give me nourishment - send vibrations out to my soul
that is what it means to live the question. 


I think a lot about 'A''s mannerisms and characteristics, how she's growing and evolving everyday. I learn a lot from her. We were playing monopoly one day and she performed a real great act of generosity. It was not about winning. It was about keeping playing the game with the person you love - you want them to win together with you. How wonderful. 


almost 3 years now in Singapore, and I'm always surprised by how different every year is. The city is not for the faint-hearted, and to be honest, with low-blood pressure. Sweltering heat and pressuring situations include the burgeoning anxiety of holding up a queue at the grocery self-checkout, or it's the 15 mins after 6pm where you wait for one of your colleagues to get up from their desk and leave first. It's not just hustle culture here, we have a structure culture as well. The structure is a blessing and curse.

You don't end up loving the question. 

- acknowledging vast horizons
- not the loss of innocence 
- the pathless path
