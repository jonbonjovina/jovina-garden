-  After 14 weeks, many hours, many many files titled human_final_ v3_mostfinal. Indd and human_1_1_1_1_1. Aep, i feel a deep sense of connection to this project, especially because the topic is about being human, something so abstract and yet so personal. In hindsight, this might just be the most ambitious project i have completed thus far. It means more to me than just a piece for my portfolio, because through the process and the research, i unearthed quite a few things about myself, and was challenged more than ever in terms of thinking and conceptualizing. In the midst of learning art and design, other things i learned were conducting research, actively looking for visual metaphors in anything i see (to the point that it was a reach), negotiating with print vendors, as well as some more technical skills, such as camera settings and bookbinding. Then in the latter term of the semester, i was challenged more than ever to figure out this insanely intricate software im not used to, and do research about a design practice ive never quite been familar with appreciating. Nonetheless, im really glad that i was able to implement and practice a lot of different things. My greatest finding was that i discovered i actually had something to say that was of value. This is something i struggled with a lot in the past year in my design in context module. Tracing my steps, i think one of the most formative experiences of this whole process was actually the very first week. The industry talk with lenne chai, i still vividly remember her saying that her art is her conveying the things she wants to say so she wasnt that concerned with style or whatever. When i figured out what i wanted to say, art arised organically from that. As the balinese say we have no art. We do everything as best as we can. This means that every process, photo-taking, editing, publicationdesigning, audio production, keyframing has to be laced with love and the best effort. That art is actually just a byproduct of life. I will end this final reflection with a quote about a discipline of art that means a lot to me, which i think can be translated to any form of art, design and life. “Poetry starts

with a lump in

the throat and a

sense of wrong, a

homesickness

and a

lovesickness.”

As humans, it is in our mortality and humanness to always want to seek to inhabit a sense of wrong. I know that in my photobook i defined being human as three things: to be conscious, to have presence and to be in relationship with others. While that is true, towards the end of this project, i found that it was actually so much simpler than that. Nevermind all the pretentious case studies on philosophy and the meaing of life, to be human is to be able to think. It is the sole thing that differentiates us from monkeys. What monkeys dont have is a lump in their throat. As long as we have this lump in our throat, it means that we still have something to say, a verse to contribute. As long as that is the case, we still have things to enquire about and explore. The humanity in us will prevail, despite the countless limitations. The beauty does lie in living in perpetual enquiry.
