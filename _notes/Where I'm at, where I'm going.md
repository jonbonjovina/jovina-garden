title: Where I'm at, where I'm going
---

Countdown to graduation as I'm writing this: 36 days, or about 5 weeks. Isn't that mindboggling? I've spent the last 2 and a half years in Singapore studying, working, growing. As my education engagement here comes to a close, the classic question arises - what do I do next after this? 

For a while, I kept my options broad. The past few months has been a flurry of both university and job applications, of both pdf and website portfolios, of splitting my mind and body into two different directions. All of this whilst working on my freelance jobs and final year project.

When it came time for decisions, I got accepted to a joint degree and master's program at the Glasgow School of Art in Scotland, studying Design for Health & Wellbeing. Around the same time, a portfolio review at school linked me with some people in the design industry, promising exciting and creative prospects. 

If I was asked a month ago, I would've gone to Scotland. I was tempted by the idea of a new adventure, exposing myself to the western world and working at understanding complex social problems bigger than myself. If I was asked a week ago, I would've answered working in Singapore and working my way up the corporate ladder.  Let me explain why I decided not to go for both of these paths:

## The optionality fallacy

This is where I fall prey to the biggest obstacle I have, the [[optionality]] fallacy. Having many options to choose from lulls you into the feeling of safety, and that was what I so often did.  I wanted to do well at school so that I had more options to choose when I'm job searching. Going for further studies presents itself as a way for me to win more options at the end of the day. It was safe.

But my problem wasn't the lack of options, in fact, it was the abundance of it that had me distraught. Stuck in rabbitholes of not knowing what I actually wanted from my life.  Being only 20 years of age, my knowledge of the world was limited to the coccoon that being a student offers. My commitments were usually 6 months at max - an internship or a school assignment. My dependencies were me, myself and I. That said, how am I supposed to weigh factors such as "social impact" and accruing wealth and validation from my asian parents? How was I supposed to know what was truly important to me and what my ultimate goals were? When I thought of it this way my problems started being so trivial.

I tried to solve this through a decision making matrix. Equipped with pen and paper, I rated each path with 1-5 star values depending on factors such as "saving time", "earning more money", "validation". Regardless of the score, there's a big fault to this exercise, as we know that the real world is agnositc about human endeavours. Life is anything but stagnant and linear and when the decisions we make come into play in our lives, it affects the ecosystem as a whole. The metrics that govern our decisions today lose their value in the face of the ambiguity of tomorrow. For instance, time may not be an important factor for me now because I'm 20, that's why a master's degree seems appealing. But I can't say the same when I'm 24 years old and applying for junior level roles, can't I? We also can't extrapulate external factors in our ecosystem as well - what if I meet someone and decide to get married? 

## The prisoner's dilemma

A [blog post](https://mindslice.substack.com/p/choosing) written by Vincent Huang, a recent MIT graduate, which inspired me to write this as well, mentioned the idea of a [prisoner's dilemma](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110513/utilizing-prisoners-dilemma-business-and-economy.asp), a game theory often used as an analogy for various situations in which prisoners must choose between **defecting** (individual self interest) and **impacting** (collective wellfare). While it is in both prisoners' best interest to cooperate, the risk of the other person defecting creates uncertainty and incentivizes defection. It took me a while to wrap my head around it but think of it this way: 2 brains put together to solve 1 critical universal problem solves it much quicker than if each person were to solve their own individual problems. 

> *i thought about all the people older than me who have inspired me and shaped my life over the years, and then i thought about all the people younger than me who look up to me for advice. just as i use the stories of people who have come before me as benchmarks and references for what i should do, i know that people who come after me will use my story as guidance for what they can do. and while there are many parts of this decision that i’m very confused about, here is one fact i am absolutely certain of: **i want to live in a world where young people choose to work on interesting, impactful, and difficult problems*** - Vincent Huang

The thing with choosing to stay and solve is that it risks your own problems being unsolved forever. There's a hoard of people out there who will choose defecting because it's the safe and rational decision to make. It's people like Vincent taking a leap of faith and trusting that others will do the same that are rare to find. 

So I'm deciding to join the movement and do the same.

## Cosmic coincidence
 
As for my take on it - to have my life decisions changed irrevocably and at such an alarming speed can only be described as cosmic. I can't really explain in detail what happened to me and who I met that empowered me to take this leap of faith. What I can say is that I believe we don't arrive at decisions through mere cognition and rationalization, the right decisions arise organically from our own values and through tinkering with the universe. Critical coincidences are happening around us as we speak. I met my best friend through a hitched ride. A conversation with my dentist made me wanna be a designer. A click of a button connected me to someone who's currently in the position to either change my life or becomes a valuable lesson. 

>*You are the people you've met. The movies you see. The songs you dance to. The words you cry to*. - Evlin, writer and my best friend

Is it foolish to let 1 moment influence our live trajectory and possibly destroy all that we've worked for? Having lived my whole life playing it safe, I don't think so anymore. It's only treacherous to live life cradling one's soft palms when God created the world with texture and the sense of touch in you with a purpose. It's only foolish to see the world through black-tinted glass when beauty is all around you and colour lives with reason on the electromagnetic spectrum. **It's only sinful, a rarefied monstrosity, a peak betrayal, if we hold ourselves back to the life we wanna live out of fear of actually living it.** 

## Conclusion

So the question comes back to the title of this whole thing - *where am I going?*

Sounds kind of anticlimatic but - **No destination.** 

In less philosophical terms, I'll be going on a **gap year.** 

However, no destination does not necessarily mean no direction. 

This might not gel well with skeptics but I'll be attaching myself to a mentor. Think Jiraiya and Naruto, Oogway and Po, Luke and Yoda, you get the point. I'll share the details of this story some other time or if anyone is truly interested, feel free to message me. What really convinced me to train under this person wasn't his mighty technical skills or how incredibly smart he is, but the underlying realization that **he was free in ways that I was not**. His blazing confidence in his creation and conviction in his vision. That's what I truly wanna learn. The UI/UX skills, mastering the pipeline, having a cool body of work will just be a byproduct of it. It is ultimately so rare to have someone who sees your potential and also your flaws and can hold both those sides of you in equal regard to help you grow

>“Don’t surround yourself with ‘smarter’ people. The trick is to surround yourself with people who are free in ways you’re not.”([Ribbonfarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/11/05/dont-surround-yourself-with-smarter-people/))  

But what I choose to do with my time and what I wanna learn is definitely different from yours or anyone else's. If there's any takeaway from my story and my decision to take the unconventional route is that we shouldn't be afraid to fail, the only thing we should be afraid of is complacency. So that if nothing comes out of this, at least I tried and I can always pick myself up and apply for a job.  Even if I make a turn and after posting this I decide to go to Scotland, there's a paradigm in me that has already shifted. An obtrusive thinking pattern I've already destroyed. A small part of me that already dreams bigger. I refuse to regret this decision in the future. Coming back to the analogy of the prisoner's dilemma - the world is probably only one person away from solving one critical issue. If with what I have and what I can do can amount to a thing that betters the life of someone just by a bit, then it's enough for me to keep on going.

To be very honest, I am very disoriented about most of this journey, but what I can say is that I'm immensely excited to see what'll come out of this. The only thing I'm sure of is that the biggest commodity I have right now is time, and the only limit I have is my appetite for growth. I sincerely believe this is true for you reading this as well. **Being in a situation and with company that makes me feel uninformed, disoriented, dissatisfied, fearful, challenged is a wonderful place to be. It humbles you and most importantly, dares you to grow.** 

If you would like to follow me on this journey, I'll be posting updates on my [twitter ](https://twitter.com/JovinaRahardjo) and through this lil personal blog.
