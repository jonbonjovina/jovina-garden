Last week, I stumbled upon a really interesting thread.

Really hardhitting point there on how being the best is good for the ego but not exactly necessary. I have definitely been in my fair share of brutal perfectionism. One concrete example being my portfolio website, which took near to 8 months to complete and everyday I'm still adding stuff to it.

**Perfectionism relates very closely with the [[optionality]] fallacy.**  I'd interpret it as 'keeping as many options as possible, just in case one fails'. Here's why I think so: 

Sometimes, I go about my life thinking there's a checklist of imperative and urgent things I must complete just because it's the norm. Get a degree, get a full-time job, buy a house, get married, have kids. A pipeline of tried and tested formulas to life. "If you get a degree, you'll get a full time job, and if you have a full time job, you'll be able to save up enough to buy a house" - that's what my mom says at least. 

When the risk of pursuing other options is great, we fall prey to "defaulting" to the safest possible option. 

>***Human beings aren't wired to be successful, we are wired to be comfortable and avoid pain** -* Brianna Wiest, The Mountain Is You. 

Which is why we collect optionality like get out of jail free cards in monopoly, feeling safer and comfortable knowing we are risk-proofing ourselves. 

To me, my perfectionism is a byproduct of this. Some people are perfectionists because they're competitive, like the writer's daughter as opposed to her son. Me, I'm one because I'm addicted to the lulling feeling of security. Minimizing risks and maximizing the gap of failure through my efforts. For example, If I get a 100, the risk of me getting a B is smaller than if I get an 81. I strive for the 100 even if 81 and 100 virtually makes no difference and I'll still be getting an A. 

This was a very constricting mindset for me. It was what made me struggle so much with portfolios, blogs, and publish buttons. Thankfully, this practice of [[digital-garden|digital gardening]] has been a good exercise to combat this
