I'm not really one to read nonfiction or self-help, but this year has been the year of venturing outside of my usual genres. Found myself unexpectedly enjoying a self-help book called  [The Courage To Be Disliked: How to free yourself, change your life and achieve real happiness](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/28473aa9-7e42-4ce1-9cb2-2534d9629ccd) by Fumitake Koga. View my [[bookshelf]] here! It has a unique conversation format, spins like fiction, in a way, so I totally knocked myself out within a week. 

Alfred Adler advocated that human beings must be understood through their social context. The central message of his theory is that we decide how we live by giving our own meaning to our experiences. This directly opposes theory of aetiology (the study of causation), which Freud coined. 

Funnily enough, Adler and Freud were similar in age and research buddies during their time. Anyways, Adler studies teleology which is the study of the purpose of a given phenomenon, rather than its cause. In this note I'll present some ideas from the book: 

## Aetiology vs Teleology

- In teleology, our emotions and actions live to fulfill our goals. People are not driven by past causes, but move toward goals that they themselves set. We are self-determining creatures.
- In aetiology, our past experiences greatly affect the way we live our lives.  We are determined by what has happened to us. 
- Example: Boy A is a recluse and a shut-in. He's this way because his parents abused him in the past. Aetiology studies how his traumatic experiences affected his brain chemistry to make him recluse etc. Teleology states that he created this "recluse personality" for himself to fullfill his self-conditioned goal to feel safe and never having to deal with pain again.
- In other words, teleology puts the power back in the hands of the boy. Whilst aetiology puts the power in the hands of the situation. Which is to say, if we subscribe to aetiology, we can't move a single step forward

## Why don't we want to change?

We unconsciously choose our own personality at the age of 10. Choosing otherwise right now is not secure and comfortable. Human beings are born to be comfortable not to be happy. To be happy we need to grapple with discomfort.

We content with being in the cocoon of “I can do it if I try”. If we actually do the thing, we risk failing, so we make excuses like I’m too busy or I’ve got other priorities. For example, person B is scared to submit his work to a competition, putting it off for years. If he gets rejected, so be it. If he did, he might grow, or discover that he should pursue something different. Either way, he would be able to move on. That is what changing your current lifestyle is about. He won’t get anywhere by not submitting anything.

Believing in the causal relationship of the universe deludes us to be complacent in where we currently are. "I’m shy so I can’t ever post my writing or thoughts online." It’s simply that it’s scary to take even one step forward; also, that you don’t want to make realistic efforts. 

## All problems are interpersonal problems

So we've acknowledged that we create and fabricate our own symptoms based off our own fears turned to goals. The clue here is that these symptoms and goals are born out of situational context. There is no such thing as worry that is completely defined by the individual; so-called internal worry does not exist. Whatever the worry that may arise, the shadows of other people are always present.

From a grander perspective, If there weren’t any other people on this planet, we’d have no one to compare ourselves to. Therefore, no inferiority would arise, right? Though of course that is not how the world works, and we find ourselves in social situations on the daily.


## Inferiority 

Adler is saying that not at all inferiority is bad. The pursuit of superiority and the feeling of inferiority are not diseases, but stimulants to normal, healthy striving and growth. If it is not used in the wrong way, the feeling of inferiority, too, can promote striving and growth.

> **Inferiority as a feeling can be a stimulant of growth, a motivation to do better. An inferiority complex however is an excuse to not do better.** 

Here's where it gets interesting though. Superiority complexes tend to breed from the inferiority feeling. We are so scared to feel inferior that we force ourselves to be superior through other things, indulging in a fabricated feeling of superiority.

For e.g. wearing an expensive handbag. Do you actually like that logogram imprinted on everything you own or the pride it gives you, and the community it allows you to access?  

Living on borrowed power makes us liable to living according to other people’s value system. We don't actually value handbags, we just think we do because other people do.

  

## Using weakness to have power 

When you think of it, the most powerful being in society is the baby. Babies cannot do anything, garnering sympathy for its helplessness. Adults do anything for the baby, regardless of whether its out of love or not. 

Determining that we are "special" due to our past misfortunes primes us to believe that we need it to deserve attention or better treatment. So long as a person relies on their misfortune to be special, they will always need and cling on to that misfortune. 

  
## Power struggles

Why are disagreements so often power struggles? Because when we believe that we are right, we emphasize that the other party is wrong. At that point, the focus of the discussion shifts from ‘the rightness of the assertions’ to ‘the state of the interpersonal relationship’. In other words, the conviction that ‘I am right’ leads to the assumption that ‘this person is wrong’, and finally it becomes a contest and you are thinking, I have to win. It’s a power struggle through and through. 

> “There are the following two objectives for behaviour: to be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society. And there are the following two objectives for the psychology that supports these behaviours: the consciousness that I have the ability and the consciousness that people are my comrades ”

In that sense, life is not meant to be looked at from a standpoint of good and evil like other philosophers. Adlerian psychology talks about life tasks, objectives and roles we must fullfil and life lies, the ideas we fabricate to fulfil the goal of not doing something or pretexts. Even if you are avoiding your life tasks and clinging to your life-lies, it isn’t because you are steeped in evil. It is not an issue to be condemned from a moralistic standpoint. It is only an issue of courage.


## Recommendations from my therapist 

Though adlerian theory does a great deal of empowering, it negates the undeniable fact that our past does indeed shape us in a way that is sometimes outside of our control. During the formative years of our childhood, how would we be able to deflect the wrong teachings of our parents? The causal relationship between experiences and behaviours cannot be ignored, as Freud suggests. To truly judge from an objective perspective, I have to read deeper into Freudian psychology, which I haven’t at the moment.
